# AutoROE

An external network assessment tool to prevent mistyped scans 1) violating Rules of Engagement 2) attacking benign IPs 

This tool whitelists ALL internal IP ranges, and so is useless in this stage of development for internal testing.

I provide no guarantee it's in a fully functional state/will prevent launching accidental attacks. That said, just chmod +x and enjoy.


Future goals:
-IPv6 integration
